Today I sat for and passed the LPI Linux Essentials certification exam. This is the first exam I've sat for and I am walking away with a good feeling about making progress.

When I studied music, one of my teachers showed me an interesting technique for evaluation. We were constantly setting and working towards small goals along larger paths of improvement. If too much time went by without any progress, we would re-evaluate what was going on and break it down into smaller pieces. But whenever a goal was met, he would tell me to "take a win". Positive reinforcement is absolutely necessary in the learning path, otherwise we can get frustrated and even abandon our studies. 

So today I am "taking a win" and happy about my accomplishment. These feel like baby steps towards my other certification goals, but it's important to take them and celebrate the positive moments.
