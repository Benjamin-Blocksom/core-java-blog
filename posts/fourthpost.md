I think it's worth reminding myself that the main purpose of this blog is to keep an honest record of my preparation for the Java OCA-8 exam. Honestly, I'd love to think I had a slam dunk and that my system brought me from failing to passing in the space of 3 months. But the objective truth shows that I started out scoring in the 20-30% range (as assessed by Enthuware practice exams) and that now I am in the 45-55% range. At the very least, this means that I still have to make a solid effort to bring myself into passing range. It also shows that I may have reached a plateau with my approach and will need to change something in order to get to the next level.

It's difficult to come to grips with this since a few of my colleagues from the corporate boot camp already passed the exam. Additionally, since I was placed on furlough I feel the stressful demand of gaining employment and have equated passing this exam to being a key that end. Further, being at the plateau stage makes me question the worth of my effort and whether the time spent will actually yield anything.

So that's the navel-gazing. Let's now look at the code I got confused on from the objective-wise test on data types.
