This blog is about studying for the **[Java SE I Exam(1ZO-808)](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-8-programmer-i/pexam_1Z0-808)**. In essence, it is a writing collection of how I approached this task and composed my own code. Inside you will reviews of commercial study materials, opinion pieces on the learning process, and, most importantly, code snippets that focus on some element of the core Java language.

This **site** was built with **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)**, a really neat project for quickly scaffolding static sites. Pages were generated from [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), a powerful templating language for JavaScript. Site was deployed on Netlify(http://www.netlify.com) using their serverless backend services. 

My name is **Benjamin Blocksom** and I am a full stack developer. Currently, I am also preparing to take the LPI Linux Administrator (LPIC-1) and Amazon AWS Certified Solutions Architect (SAA-C02) exams.
