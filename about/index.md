Recently I started studying for the **[Java SE I Exam(1ZO-808)](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-8-programmer-i/pexam_1Z0-808)** and am about 3-4 weeks away from being properly prepared in order to pass. In the process I wrote a *ton* of code snippets that focus on some element of the core Java language. This is a writing collection of how I approached this task and composed my own code.

This site was built with **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)**, a really neat project for quickly scaffolding static sites.  

**Benjamin Blocksom** is a full stack developer also currenty working certification for Linux Administration (LPI Linux Essentials) and Amazon AWS Certified Solutions Architect (SAA-C02).
