This year I began studying for the **[Java SE 8 Oracle Ceritified Associate Exam(1ZO-808)](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-8-programmer-i/pexam_1Z0-808)**. Early on, I felt the best way to review the concepts I was learning was by writing my own examples. In the process, I wrote a *bunch* of code snippets that focus on some element of the core Java language. You can see the full repository [here](https://github.com/Benjamin-Blocksom/java-oca-prep). This blog is a collection of writings on this approach and comments on selected code.

This **site** was built with **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)**, a really neat project for quickly scaffolding static sites. Pages were generated from **[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)**, a powerful templating language for JavaScript. Site was deployed on **[Netlify](http://www.netlify.com)** using their serverless backend services. 

The author, **[Benjamin Blocksom](http://benjaminblocksom.com)**, is a full stack developer also currenty pursuing certification in Linux Administration (LPI Linux Essentials) and as an Amazon AWS Certified Solutions Architect (SAA-C02).
